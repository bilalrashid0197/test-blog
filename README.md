<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack web application where the owner can upload daily blog updates on a variety of topics. The application features a clean and responsive user interface that allows readers to easily browse and engage with the content.

1. <strong>Home Page</strong>: The "Home" page offers a modern UI/UX interface where users can explore the latest blog posts. The posts are organized into the following sections:
    <br>
    - Trending: This section highlights the posts that are generating the most discussion and engagement among readers. It surfaces the most popular and thought-provoking content.
    - Technology: This section is dedicated to the latest news, insights, and tutorials on emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, cloud computing, and more.
    - Travel: This section provides readers with inspiring stories, destination guides, and travel tips from around the world, helping them plan their next adventure.
    - All Posts: This section shows a comprehensive list of all the blog posts, allowing users to easily navigate and discover new content.

2. <strong>Each Blog Page</strong>: Using Next.js, each blog has a separate page that allows users to read the blog's contents. Some features of each page include:
    - Content: This section includes the blog's title, date posted, author, pictures, and the full blog content.
    - Other Posts: A UI on the right side of the page allows users to check out other blog posts.
